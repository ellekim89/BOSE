## Our Approach
- Our approach for BloxScore was to figure things out step by step. First came the idea, then wireframes and and finally figuring out what we'd need to get this done.
- A big part of our projects were the APIs we'd need to pull from. Each of our team members researched the documentations and how to pull data from the websites before we got together.
- From here, we divided up the work and the coding process began. We'd check in every couple hours just to check out progress and to see what else could get done so that things can get done at an effective pace. Once we'd break for the day, we had tasks divvied up.
- Once we had our MVP (minimum viable product) and minimum requirements of the assignment, we spruced up our web app and debugged for a cleaner user experience.

## User Stories
###Jenny - 18 year old, Female 
- Jenny is a local 18 year old that got accepted to Seattle University. She wants a place that is walking distance to her school and close to a lot of cool restaurants. She doesn't want to drive much due to the expensive parking in Seattle.

### Adam - 26 year old, Male
- Adam is moving from San Francisco to Seattle. He recently got a job offer at Amazon. He's looking for places with a fun and interesting community that is nearby work. He's rather not drive but have work be in a working distance. 

### The Smiths - family of 4
- The Smiths are moving to Seattle from Ohio because Dad Smith got a job at Zillow. Mom Smith wants a place where there are good schools for her children. She doesn't want a place too close to the city so her children aren't tempted to play hooky but also not too far so that her husband doesn't have to commute for too long.

##Wireframes

##Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles
- One of our biggest hurdles was getting data from ALL of our APIs. but Sam was AMAZING and brilliantly wrote an async waterfall code. * cue music Waterfalls by TLC *

- One of our unsolved problems lie with Zillow and the information that is available. A lot of the properties did not allow Zillow to pass their information to others through their API's. So it was hard finding addresses that our program was allowed to analyze.

- Another issue we had was when our calls didn't have any information to pass through. This gave no social interaction score or no images for either instagram or zillow.
